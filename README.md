# Ender-Quarry-Mod
The port of the ender quarry from ExU 1.7.10.<br />
<br />
What is included:<br />
• The quarry itself<br />
• The markers<br />
• Chunk loading<br />
• All upgrades<br />
• New redstone control functionality<br />
• FE/RF support<br />
• Quarry extracts items from the chests it mines<br />
<br />
What is not included: <br />
• Defining the quarried area by fence (who lays a 1000 x 1000 fence anyway?). <br />
• Crafing recipes. This mod may be considered OP in some packs so if pack creators are going to adjust these I have no reason to code them. Use crafttweaker instead.<br />
• Growing flowers over the quarried area. This breaks thermodynamics so it is not cool.<br />

As noted before this is a port. The code and credits go to RWTema, the original author of Extra Utillities. This repository will be taken down if the original author requests so.<br />
